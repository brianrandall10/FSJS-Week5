// 1.)  Use the PokéAPI from http://pokeapi.co along with jQuery's getJSON function to retrieve the first 20 Pokémon.
// 1.1)  Use the addPokemon function to show each of the Pokémon names that were retrieved.  
//Hint: Learn how to access resources via the documentation http://pokeapi.co/docsv2/#resource-lists


// 2.)  Use jQuery to create a click handler for the next and previous buttons.
// 2.1) Use the "next" and "previous" properties of the pokemon resource object to get the next or previous list of Pokémon.
// 2.2) When a user clicks next or previous, remove all existing Pokémon from the ul element and add the new list of Pokémon.  
// 2.3) Use jQuery to disable the next/previous buttons if there are no more Pokémon to retrieve in that direction.  

/*  Super Awesome Bonus!
    When you click on a Pokémon name, hide all the names and show a larger card that contains details about that Pokémon such as their sprite (picture), name,
    type or anything else you would like to include.  Add a way to go back to the list when your're done looking at the detail.

    Be creative, you can style/arrange the detail information however you like!
